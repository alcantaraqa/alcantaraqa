- 👋 Hi, I’m @alcantaraqa or Queren Alcantara
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, bio-stuff, science and webdesign. I also do scientific illustrations!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, HTML, CSS (always learning! It never seems to end), Javascript and bootstrap (baby steps, folks. Baby steps..) - Besides other scientific tools ;)
      Because I'm still a scientist!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can! The secret to learn is to make mistakes and try again.
- 📫 You can reach me @ queren.alcantara@alumni.usp.br
